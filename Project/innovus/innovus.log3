	For postRoute effortLevel low extraction, the coupling_c_th value will be used only when the -capFilterMode parameter of the setExtractRCMode command is set to relAndCoup or relOrCoup. Default value of -capFilterMode parameter in postRoute extraction effortLevel low is relOnly.

**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-1182):	The clock_gating_cells property has no usable full-cycle clock gates for power domain auto-default. Gating limited for clock tree clk. You may be able to solve this problem by specifying a list of lib_cells to use with the clock_gating_cells property.
**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-4313):	Innovus cannot determine the drive strength of clk, which drives the root of clock_tree clk. To time this clock tree, Innovus will assume that it is driven by a driver cell with a fixed output slew of 0.000 and a maximum driven capacitance of 0.000. It is recommended that you set the source_driver property on this clock tree appropriately in order to correct this assumption.

Clock Tree Violations Report
============================

The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.


Max Capacitance Violations
--------------------------

Did not meet the max_capacitance constraint of 0.000pF below the root driver for clock_tree clk at (42.000,278.200), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net clk which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net}. Achieved capacitance of 1.020pF.

**WARN: (SDF-808):	The software is currently operating in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_delay_calc'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.

WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'watch_chip' is attached to the technology library 'tsmc18'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
WARNING (XSTRM-107): Existing cells in the target library will be overwritten if the cell names in the Stream file and the target library are the same. To prevent this, set the '-writeMode' option to 'noOverwrite'.

INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If a viaMap file, corresponding technology file or technology library exist, then use the '-viaMap' option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.

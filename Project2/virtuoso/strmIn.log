WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'watch_chip' is attached to the technology library 'tsmc18'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
WARNING (XSTRM-107): Existing cells in the target library will be overwritten if the cell names in the Stream file and the target library are the same. To prevent this, set the '-writeMode' option to 'noOverwrite'.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /research/ece/lnis-teaching/Designkits/tsmc180nm/pdk/tsmc18/tsmc18.layermap
INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If a viaMap file, corresponding technology file or technology library exist, then use the '-viaMap' option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.

INFO (XSTRM-80075): Via detection cannot use a stdViaDef for "VIA2NORTH" due to rounding errors. A customViaDef has been used instead. Use the -dbuPerUU option to increase the DBUperUU to enable detection of stdViaDef.
INFO (XSTRM-81000): Via detection cannot create new via definition for "VIA2NORTH" because the technology database is not writable. The candidate via cell will be mapped to regular cell and the references to it instances.
INFO (XSTRM-80075): Via detection cannot use a stdViaDef for "soc_top_VIA9" due to rounding errors. A customViaDef has been used instead. Use the -dbuPerUU option to increase the DBUperUU to enable detection of stdViaDef.

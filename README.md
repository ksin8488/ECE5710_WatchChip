Project 2 is the directory containing the modfiied sealring_merged (our layout including the cirucit, polyfill, metalfill, and sealring) to pass the DRC/LVS checks. The DRC run file is nested within the project2/virtuoso/calibre directory as the fullchip runset. The LVS likewise can be found within the project2/virtuoso/calibre directory as the full LVS runset. You must ensure that on the inputs of the LVS run the sealring_merged.sp is your netlist file. Additionally the corresponding .gds file can be found within the project2/virtuoso directory as Ella_Kashish_Nick_.gds.
